# About

Created by Matthew Phan, Joshua Kraitberg, and Daniel Chang.

This was our capstone project at Seneca College.  It was conducted across three-semesters.  The original repo was created by our professor and has since been deleted.  So I made this repo.

For our project our group decided to create a scheduling web application using ASP .NET and C#.  The UI used bootstrap and AJAX for desired effects.

For an indepth overview of complete functionality you can read the [requirement document](Team10SysReq.doc) and checkout out the [UML](RaidExec.uml).

# How to Run
 
Originally, there was a server for this hosted on Azure.  That server has long since been taken down due to fiscal restraints.  Therefore, it must be run locally on visual studio.

The default admmin accout is:
User: wierdo1111
Password: Password123! 

More users can be created as needed.
